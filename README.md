# Compiler Design

Mini Compiler for Python 3.x with support for **FOR,WHILE constructs and other basic syntax**.

We know that there are too many folders in the repo. Go to [FINAL](https://github.com/sreyansb/Compiler_Design/tree/master/FINAL) and run `chmod +x work.sh`. Then simply run `work.sh` and you will get the outputs.

The parser file is `parser_file_with_values.y` and the lexer file is `lex_file.l`
The tests file are in [`Code_Optimization/tests`](https://github.com/sreyansb/Python_Mini_Compiler/tree/master/FINAL/Code_Optimization/tests) folder of the `FINAL` folder.

Made as a part of Compiler Design Subject for 6th semester by [Revanth](https://github.com/RevanthBabuPN), [Sahith](https://github.com/Sahith02) and [me](https://github.com/sreyansb).
